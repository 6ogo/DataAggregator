# üß† Marketing Data Aggregation and Feature Engineering Pipeline

This Python script processes and aggregates multiple raw datasets related to car sales and marketing in Sweden, transforming them into a **weekly-level dataset** ready for modeling (e.g. Marketing Mix Modeling). It handles **data cleaning**, **region standardization**, **date filtering**, **pivoting**, and **feature engineering** (like holidays and Ramadan flags).
